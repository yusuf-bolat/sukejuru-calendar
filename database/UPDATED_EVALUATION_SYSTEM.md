#### **Step 3: Assignment Feedback**
- Were there feedback on your assignments? (Yes/No)
- If yes: Was feedback on assignments helpful for improvement? (1-5 stars)

#### **Step 4: Overall Experience**

## üìä **Updated Database Schema**

### New `course_evaluations` Table Structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE course_evaluations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    course_id INTEGER REFERENCES courses(id),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    
    -- Course Content (1-5 scale)
    content_clarity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    content_interest INTEGER NOT NULL,
    materials_helpful INTEGER NOT NULL,
    
    -- Time Commitment (categorical)
    hours_per_week VARCHAR(10) CHECK (IN ('<3h', '3-5h', '5-10h', '>10h')),
    
    -- Instructor Questions
    instructor_clarity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    teaching_engaging VARCHAR(10) CHECK (IN ('Yes', 'No', 'Somewhat')),
    grading_transparent VARCHAR(10) CHECK (IN ('Yes', 'No', 'Somewhat')),
    
    -- Feedback Questions
    received_feedback BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    feedback_helpful INTEGER CHECK (1-5 scale, only if received_feedback),
    
    -- Overall Questions
    overall_satisfaction INTEGER NOT NULL,
    liked_most TEXT,
    would_improve TEXT,
    
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(course_id, user_id)
);
```

### Updated Statistics Function:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_course_evaluation_stats()
RETURNS TABLE (
    course_id INTEGER,
    avg_content_clarity NUMERIC,
    avg_content_interest NUMERIC,
    avg_materials_helpful NUMERIC,
    avg_instructor_clarity NUMERIC,
    avg_overall_satisfaction NUMERIC,
    total_evaluations BIGINT,
    teaching_engaging_yes_percent NUMERIC,
    grading_transparent_yes_percent NUMERIC,
    received_feedback_percent NUMERIC,
    avg_feedback_helpful NUMERIC,
    hours_distribution JSONB
);
```

## üé® **Frontend Updates**

### **CourseEvaluationModal.tsx** - Completely Rebuilt
- **5-step progressive form** with logical question grouping
- **Smart validation** - Step 3 adapts based on feedback question response
- **Enhanced UI components**:
  - Star rating interface with hover effects
  - Yes/No/Somewhat button groups
  - Categorical time selection with descriptive labels
  - Optional text areas with placeholder guidance
  - Progress tracking with visual indicators

### **CourseDetailModal.tsx** - Enhanced Statistics Display

## üîß **Technical Improvements**

### TypeScript Types
```typescript
interface EvaluationFormData {
  // Course Content Questions
  content_clarity: number;
  content_interest: number;
  materials_helpful: number;
  
  // Time Commitment
  hours_per_week: '<3h' | '3-5h' | '5-10h' | '>10h';
  
  // Instructor Questions
  instructor_clarity: number;
  teaching_engaging: 'Yes' | 'No' | 'Somewhat';
  grading_transparent: 'Yes' | 'No' | 'Somewhat';
  
  // Feedback Questions
  received_feedback: boolean;
  feedback_helpful?: number;
  
  // Overall Questions
  overall_satisfaction: number;
  liked_most?: string;
  would_improve?: string;
}
```

### Database Functions
- `get_course_evaluation_stats()` - Comprehensive statistics calculation
- `user_has_evaluated_course()` - Duplicate prevention
- `get_course_feedback()` - Anonymous feedback retrieval
- `courses_with_stats` view - Easy querying with statistics

## üéØ **Benefits of New Structure**

### **Better Organization**
- Logical flow from course content ‚Üí teaching ‚Üí feedback ‚Üí overall
- Clear separation of different evaluation aspects
- Progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load

### **More Actionable Data**
- **Content quality metrics** help improve course materials
- **Teaching effectiveness** separated from course content
- **Feedback quality assessment** helps instructors improve
- **Time commitment tracking** helps students plan schedules

### **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Conditional questions** (feedback helpful only if received feedback)
- **Clear question labeling** removes ambiguity
- **Categorical time selection** easier than numeric input
- **Targeted text feedback** more useful than general comments

### **Improved Analytics**
- **Hours distribution visualization** shows time commitment patterns
- **Yes/No/Somewhat percentages** easier to interpret
- **Separate content vs. teaching metrics** for targeted improvements
- **Anonymous feedback categorization** (liked vs. improve)
